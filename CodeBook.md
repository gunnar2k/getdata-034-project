# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

A collection of mean and std values based on the original dataset by the following people. This codebook is based on the  original codebook with approprate updates and additions to show the mean and std values.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

# For each record it is provided:

- Mean and standard deviation values for: Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Mean and standard deviation values for: Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

# The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.md'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'dataset/train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'dataset/train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'dataset/test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'dataset/test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.


# Notes:
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
